## BrickKit

This is a BrickKit component: `component.yaml` is all the platform reads. The rules it relies on:

- `configSchema` keys are the environment variable names the code reads. Never use a reserved name: `COMPONENT_ID`, `COMPONENT_VERSION`, `PORT`, `BRICKKIT_SERVED_MEMBERS`, `BRICKKIT_SERVED_MEMBERS_CONFIG`, or any `*_ENDPOINT`.
- Dependencies are exact versions. A dependency's address arrives as `<ID>_ENDPOINT`; an optional dependency that is absent has no variable at all, so read it with a fallback.
- `/healthz` checks only this process, never a dependency. The migration command runs from the same image and must fail on an argument it does not know.
- `BRICKKIT.md` travels to every project that uses this component and is read there without the repository: keep it in step with the code, with no relative links.
- Release: raise `metadata.version`, commit, push, `brickkit release`. `brickkit lint` checks the manifest and these docs.
- The full rules: `.claude/skills/brickkit-component/SKILL.md`; for flags ask `brickkit <command> --help`.
